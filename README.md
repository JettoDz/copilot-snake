# Copilot Snake ü§ñüêç

It's an iteration of the classic snake game with most of the basic features you'd expect, built on Java because I hate myself (As you'd expect). 

It:

* Games over on collision
* Goes over the border
* Grows as you eat the dots
* Has a difficulty selection
* Gives the choise of restart in a different difficulty or exit on game over

This is one of those project you'd get from college or high school, but I built it in a couple hours with the help of the AI and with the prompting I'd give if this was pair programming. 

It was an enjoyable experience and, while Copilot provided 90% of the code, the actual fixes to its code were done by me, and they were not few. It was also interesting to see how it reacted to my design desitions when I changed its approach to things.

Overall, is a tool worth using if you need to build something you are unfamiliar with (Game and visuals in Java, for me) but still have a good idea and drive to built it.

I might add a board size option selector. Might not. dunno
